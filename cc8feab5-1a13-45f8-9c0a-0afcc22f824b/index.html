<p>Have you ever read the story of Jesus' birth? Its claims are so shocking that it’s easy to trivialize or dismiss altogether. If true, however, the nativity is a compelling event offering enduring hope for our broken world.</p><p>This age-old story asserts that 2,000 years ago, in a backwater village outside Jerusalem, the unthinkable happened: God stepped out of heaven and became human in the person of Jesus Christ.</p><p>In ancient times, swaddling cloths were torn strips of fabric used to snugly wrap babies for security and warmth. A manger was a feeding trough for animals, typically found in a dirty, smelly stable of some kind.</p><p>Jesus’ brother, James, assures us that when we humbly draw near to Christ, He will draw near to us (James 4:8). This season, why not cash in on the offer? Perhaps we’ll experience a gift exchange: rags for divine kindness.</p><p>Talk about close encounters! Eternal spirit became visible, holdable, pierceable. The maker of the Pacific Ocean took on flesh, two eyebrows, a liver, and floated in amniotic fluid. Unlimited power became weak, needy, dependent upon the nourishment of a young mother.</p><p>During a December 1973 broadcast of “60 Minutes,” reporter Harry Reasoner said it this way: “… it goes beyond logic. It is either all falsehood or it is the truest thing in the world. It’s the story of the great innocence of God the baby – God in the form of man – and it has such a dramatic shock toward the heart that if it is not true, for Christians nothing is true.”</p><p>According to the book of Luke, the “Angel of the Lord” appeared to a group of frightened shepherds to announce the blessed event. “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior who is Christ the Lord.” (Luke 2:10-11).</p><p>And the peculiar signs given to identify the newborn king strike a chord of wonder. “ … this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” (Luke 2:12).</p><p>Let this sink in for just a moment … torn rags and a feeding trough. If the story is true, and this child really was Immanuel – “God with us” – why would he allow himself to be clothed in such humble garments and placed in a crude crib?</p><p>Perhaps these signs were not only for the shepherds long ago. Maybe they are timeless tokens pointing to the humble nature of Christ and the transforming work He offers today.</p><p>Through them, I can imagine Jesus saying: “I still wrap myself in torn rags – not as a baby in swaddling cloths, but as a crucified and resurrected Savior. When welcomed, I come to the broken, frayed fabric of your life, places torn by your own sin and the sin of others. When invited, I come to dirty and smelly stables, too. There, I take upon myself your rags of shame, guilt, hopelessness, fear, anger and injustice. In exchange, I freely offer myself as an ongoing feeding trough of mercy, hope, peace and strength.”</p><p>Paul, a former persecutor of Christians, boldly wrote that through Christ, “all the broken and dislocated pieces of the universe – people and things, animals and atoms – get properly fixed and fit together in vibrant harmonies, all because of his death, his blood that poured down from the cross.” (Colossians 1:20, The Message).</p><p>As we yield “the government” of our lives to Jesus, might we experience some aspect of the hope, guidance, comfort and wonder the prophet Isaiah ascribed to him: “For a child is born to us, a son is given to us. The government will rest on his shoulders. And he will be called: Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6).</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21">Of Mangers and Swaddling Cloth</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
